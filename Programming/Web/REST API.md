 REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. **REST API** is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.
 
 All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP request.
 
Working: A request is sent from client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back from the server in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image, or JSON. But now JSON is the most popular format being used in Web Services.
