 The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree where each node is an object representing a part of the document. This allows programming languages, especially [JavaScript](JavaScript.md), to interact with and modify the content, structure, and styling of the document dynamically. Here’s an overview of the key concepts:

• Tree Structure:  
The DOM models a document as a hierarchical tree structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of text becomes a node in the tree, and relationships such as parent, child, and sibling correspond to the nesting relationships in the markup.

• Dynamic Interaction:  
Through the DOM, scripts can create, delete, or modify nodes to update the content or structure of a document. This dynamic manipulation forms the basis for interactive web pages, such as changing content in response to user actions or updating parts of a page without a full reload.

• Event Handling:  
The DOM provides the framework for handling events, such as clicks, keyboard input, mouse movements, and more. Developers attach event listeners to nodes, allowing them to execute scripts when specific events occur.

• Standardized Interface:  
The DOM is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is supported by all modern browsers, ensuring a consistent programming model for web developers.

• Integration with JavaScript:  
JavaScript is the language most commonly used to work with the DOM. It provides a collection of methods and properties to traverse the DOM tree, access element attributes, and modify content. For example, functions like document.getElementById() or document.querySelector() help select and manipulate specific elements.

Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>DOM Overview Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="header">Hello, World!</h1>
  <button id="changeTextButton">Change Heading</button>

  <script>
    // Get references to the DOM elements
    const header = document.getElementById('header');
    const button = document.getElementById('changeTextButton');

    // Add an event listener to change heading text when the button is clicked
    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
      header.textContent = 'DOM Manipulated!';
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the DOM allows the JavaScript to select elements by their ID and attach an event listener that updates the heading text whenever the button is clicked.
