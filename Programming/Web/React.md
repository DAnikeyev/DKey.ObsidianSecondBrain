 React is a declarative [JavaScript](JavaScript.md) library maintained by Facebook, designed for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render components as data changes, thanks to its virtual DOM system. React focuses on rendering performance and offers flexibility, as it can be integrated with other libraries or frameworks for a complete application architecture.
