___
 is a method of grouping data into short messages in fixed format, i.e. [Network packets](Network%20packets.md), that are transmitted over a digital network. Packets are made of a **header** and a **payload**. Data in the header is used by networking hardware to direct the packet to its destination, where the payload is extracted and used by an operating system, application software, or higher layer protocols.
