 TypeScript is a superset of [JavaScript](JavaScript.md) that adds static type definitions. Developed by Microsoft, it helps catch errors during development and makes the code more maintainable and scalable. TypeScript code compiles down to standard JavaScript, which means it can run anywhere JavaScript runs. Its features include type annotations, interfaces, and other object-oriented constructs that provide better tooling and documentation support during development.
 ```typescript
 // TypeScript Example with type annotations
function greet(name: string): void {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

In summary, [JavaScript](JavaScript.md) is the backbone for interactive web experiences, while TypeScript builds on JavaScript by providing additional structure and [Type-safety](Type-safety.md), making it easier to develop and maintain larger applications.
