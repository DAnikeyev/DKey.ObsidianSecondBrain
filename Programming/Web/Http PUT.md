Up: [Http Request](Http%20Request.md)
___
 PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
 
 The difference between [Http POST](Http%20POST.md) and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.
