- [Direct memory access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access "Direct memory access") (DMA) channels
- [Port-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-mapped_I/O "Port-mapped I/O")
- [Memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O "Memory-mapped I/O")
- [Locks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_\(computer_science\) "Lock (computer science)")
- External [devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral "Peripheral")
- External memory or objects, such as memory managed in native code, from Java; or objects in the [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model") (DOM), from [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript")

### General resources

- [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit"), both time on a single CPU and use of multiple CPUs – see [multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking "Computer multitasking")
- [Random-access memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory "Random-access memory") and [virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory "Virtual memory") – see [memory management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management "Memory management")
- [Hard disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk "Hard disk") drives, include space generally, contiguous free space (such as for swap space), and use of multiple physical devices ("spindles"), since using multiple devices allows parallelism
- Cache space, including [CPU cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache "CPU cache") and MMU cache ([translation lookaside buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer "Translation lookaside buffer"))
- [Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking "Computer networking") throughput
- [Electrical power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_management "Power management")
- [Input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output "Input/output") operations
