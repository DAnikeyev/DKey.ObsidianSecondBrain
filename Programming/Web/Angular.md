 Angular is a full-fledged framework from Google that implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern on the client side. It simplifies the development and testing of single-page web applications by providing a structured approach to building rich, dynamic user interfaces. Angular emphasizes modularity and comes with features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and comprehensive tooling.
