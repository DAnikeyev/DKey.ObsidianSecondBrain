 Is a set of rules for data transfering. Transmission Control Protocol is a complement to [Internet Protocol](Internet%20Protocol.md) so the two are commonly referred to as TCP/IP. It is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a connection is established and maintained until the data exchange is complete. It is also a reliable protocol, meaning that it guarantees the delivery of data to the intended recipient. TCP/IP is used to transfer data over the internet and is the most widely used protocol for data transfer on the internet. 
 
 TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Connection is using a [[Port number]] and [[IP-address]]. 
Unit of data is a [Network packets](Network%20packets.md) 

Combination of [IP-address](IP-address.md) and [[Port number]] is called a **socket**. Duplex connection uses a [[Web socket protocol]]

[DNS](DNS.md)-servers are used to receive [IP-address](IP-address.md) based on [Domain name](Domain%20name.md)
