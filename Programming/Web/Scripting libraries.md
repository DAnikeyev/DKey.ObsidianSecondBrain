 Scripting libraries are collections of pre-written code that allow developers to perform common tasks more easily without having to write the code from scratch. These libraries are typically written in scripting languages like JavaScript and are designed to deal with a range of tasks—such as manipulating the [Document Object Model](Document%20Object%20Model.md) (DOM), handling events, or building user interfaces—in a consistent, cross-browser compatible manner.
