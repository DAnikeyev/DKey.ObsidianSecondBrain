 A **uniform resource locator** is a reference to a resource that specifies its location on a network and a mechanism for retrieving it. It is [[URI]] that specifies the location of a web resource, such as a web page, image, or video, on the internet. URLs are used to navigate the web, link to other resources, and access online content. They consist of several components, including the protocol, domain name, path, and query string. For example, the URL `https://www.example.com/page` specifies the protocol (`https`), domain name (`www.example.com`), and path (`/page`) of a web page.
