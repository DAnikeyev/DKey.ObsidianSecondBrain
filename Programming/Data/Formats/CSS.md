 CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in [[HTML]] or [[XML]]. It plays a key role in web development by separating content from design, allowing developers to create visually appealing and consistent web pages. Hereâ€™s an overview of CSS:
1. Structure and Syntax  
    CSS consists of selectors and declaration blocks. A selector determines which HTML elements the styles will apply to, while the declarations inside the curly braces specify styling properties and their values. Each declaration ends with a semicolon.
    
2. Cascading and Inheritance  
    CSS follows a cascading order, meaning that multiple style rules can apply to the same element. The final appearance is determined by rules of specificity, inheritance, and the order of declarations. This allows for flexible styling, where general styles can be overridden by more specific rules.
    
3. Responsiveness and Media Queries  
    CSS supports media queries which enable responsive design. This means you can define different styles for different devices or screen sizes, ensuring that your website looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
    
4. Modular and Reusable Styles  
    With CSS, you can create modular and reusable components by organizing styles into separate files. This helps improve maintainability and scalability of your web projects.
    
5. Preprocessors and Frameworks  
    Tools like Sass, LESS, and frameworks like Bootstrap extend CSS capabilities by adding features like variables, mixins, and grid systems. These tools can make writing complex CSS easier and more efficient.
Example
```css
/* This file defines a basic CSS styling for a simple webpage */

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

header {
  background-color: #008cba;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 1rem;
  text-align: center;
}

h1 {
  margin: 0;
}

p {
  padding: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.6;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  header {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }
  
  p {
    font-size: 0.9rem;
  }
}
```
