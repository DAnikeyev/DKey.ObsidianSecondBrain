how duplicate keys are handled in json? can key be not only string?
- - - - -
Assistant
In JSON, keys must be strings. If a JSON object contains duplicate keys, the behavior may vary depending on the JSON parser being used. Generally, the last key-value pair will override any previous ones with the same key. However, it's important to avoid duplicate keys to ensure consistent behavior across different parsers. For more details on handling data formats, you might want to check out [[Data/Formats/Markdown]] for Markdown formatting specifics.

how about empty object, like "a":{ } is this allowed?
- - - - -
Assistant
Yes, an empty object like `"a": {}` is allowed in JSON. An empty object is a valid JSON object with no key-value pairs inside it. JSON objects are collections of key-value pairs, and it's perfectly fine for an object to have no entries. This is similar to an empty dictionary in many programming languages. For more on object handling, you might be interested in the concept of [[Engineering/Creational pattern]], which discusses object creation and management.

can key in yaml has space in it?
- - - - -
Assistant
Yes, keys in YAML can have spaces in them. To include spaces in a key, you should enclose the key in quotes. For example:

```yaml
"key with spaces": value
```

This ensures that the YAML parser correctly interprets the key as a single entity, even though it contains spaces. YAML is designed to be human-readable and flexible in terms of formatting, which includes allowing spaces in keys. For more information on data formats, you might refer to [[Data/Formats/Markdown]] for related formatting practices.

is markdown using 
```somelanguage
``` a part of obsidian or this markdown rendering is also on other parsers like github/bitbucket?
- - - - -
Assistant
The use of triple backticks (\`\`\`) followed by a language identifier, such as \`\`\`javascript or \`\`\`python, for code block syntax highlighting is not exclusive to Obsidian. This feature is part of the common Markdown specification known as "fenced code blocks," which is supported by many Markdown parsers, including those used by platforms like GitHub and Bitbucket. This syntax allows for specifying the language of the code block, enabling syntax highlighting in compatible Markdown renderers. For more details on Markdown formatting, you can refer to [[Data/Formats/Markdown]].

Assistant
You can read more about Markdown, including the syntax for code blocks, in the [[Data/Formats/Markdown]] note in your Obsidian knowledge base. This note provides information on various Markdown features and formatting options.

Assistant
You can read more about Markdown and its features, including code block syntax, on the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet) available on GitHub. This resource provides a comprehensive overview of Markdown syntax and is a great place to learn about its implementation across different platforms.
