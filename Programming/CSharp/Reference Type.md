 Store references to their data. Multiple variables can reference the same object.
### Passing Reference Types

When passing reference types to methods, you pass a reference to the object, not the actual object itself. Changes made to the object inside the method will affect the original object.
## Reference types
- [[Class]]
- [[Interface]]
- [[Delegate]]
- [[Record]]
- [[Dynamic]]
- [[Object]] is an alias for System.Object so it is a reference type
- [[String]] is an alias for System.String class so it is a reference type
- [Collection](Collection)

# References
