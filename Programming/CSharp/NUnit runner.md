 is a [Test runner](Test%20runner.md) for running tests in all contexts (for example, continuous integration (CI) pipelines, CLI, Visual Studio Test Explorer, and VS Code Text Explorer). The NUnit runner is embedded directly in your NUnit test projects, and there are no other app dependencies, such as `vstest.console` or `dotnet test`, needed to run your tests.
