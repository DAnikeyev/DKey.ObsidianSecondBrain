 [gRPC](gRPC.md) is a highly efficient, open-source, general-purpose RPC framework developed by Google. It is based on the HTTP/2 protocol and uses [Protobuf](Protobuf.md) as the interface definition language. 
 [DotNet Frameworks](DotNet%20Frameworks.md) used to have WCF framework that is now obsolete.

### Contract-first approach
1. Define a service using Protocol Buffers.
2. Generate client and server code from the service definition.
3. Implement the server and client code.
