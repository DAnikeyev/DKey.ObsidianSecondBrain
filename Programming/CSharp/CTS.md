## Features
 - Framework for cross-language integration, type safety  and high performance code execution
 - Object-oriented programming model that supports the complete implementation of many programming languages
 - Defines rules that languages must follow, which helps ensure that objects written in different languages can interact with each other
 - Provide a library of base data types like Int32, Int64, and Boolean.

## Types in CTS
 - [[Class]]
 - [[Interface]]
 - [Delegate](Delegate.md)
 - [[Enumeration]]
