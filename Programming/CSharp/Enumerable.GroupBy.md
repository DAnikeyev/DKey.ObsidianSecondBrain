        // - elementSelector: selects the element to be grouped (here we keep the full Employee object).
        // - resultSelector: transforms each grouping into a custom shape with summary information.
        var groupedResult = employees.GroupBy(
            employee => employee.Department,   // keySelector: selects the department key
