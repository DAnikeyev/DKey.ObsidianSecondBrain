 Context switching in Windows threads refers to the process by which the operating system (OS) interrupts the execution of a running thread and saves its state so that it can resume execution later, while simultaneously restoring the state of another thread that is ready to run. This mechanism is at the heart of multitasking and is essential for allowing multiple threads to share a single CPU.
Thread is run for about 30ms before switching.
## Key points
1. Role of the Windows Scheduler:
    
    - Windows employs a preemptive multitasking model where the kernel’s scheduler is responsible for managing threads. It determines which thread should run next based on priority, quantum expiration, and various other factors.
    - The scheduler maintains a ready queue of threads waiting to execute and selects a suitable candidate when a thread’s time slice expires or when a higher-priority thread becomes runnable.
2. The Process of Context Switching:
    
    - When a context switch occurs, the OS saves the context of the current thread. This context typically includes the CPU registers (such as the instruction pointer, stack pointer, and other general-purpose registers), as well as additional state information such as floating-point registers.
    - The saved context is stored in a thread control block (TCB). For Windows, the Thread Environment Block (TEB) may also play a role in maintaining per-thread information.
    - The OS then loads the context of the next thread scheduled for execution. This means restoring its CPU registers and any other state information so that the thread can continue from where it left off.
    - The overhead of this process is critical, as frequent or inefficient context switches can lead to performance degradation.
3. Hardware and Architectural Considerations:
    
    - Modern CPUs are designed with support for efficient context switching. For instance, they may offer hardware support for saving and restoring a subset of registers quickly.
    - In Windows, mechanisms like interrupt handling are triggered by hardware timers or other events, which in turn prompt the scheduler to evaluate whether a context switch is needed.
4. Thread Prioritization and Scheduling:
    
    - Windows assigns a priority to each thread, and the scheduler takes these priorities into account when deciding which thread to run. For example, real-time or high-priority threads can preempt lower-priority threads.
    - Context switches may be triggered not only by time slice expiration but also by events such as I/O completion or synchronization signals (e.g., when a thread is waiting on an object).
5. Trade-offs and Performance:
    
    - Although context switching is essential for multitasking, it incurs overhead. The time taken to save and load contexts (along with potential cache misses) is non-negligible, especially in high-performance or real-time scenarios.
    - Windows provides various optimization strategies to reduce the cost of context switches (such as reducing the frequency or batching scheduling decisions).
6. Software and Debugging Implications:
    
    - For developers, understanding thread context switching is important when diagnosing issues related to performance, race conditions, or deadlocks.
    - Debuggers and performance analysis tools may provide insights into context switching behavior to help optimize applications.
