 The null-coalescing operator `??` returns the value of its left-hand operand if it isn't `null`; otherwise, it evaluates the right-hand operand and returns its result. The `??` operator doesn't evaluate its right-hand operand if the left-hand operand evaluates to non-null. The null-coalescing assignment operator `??=` assigns the value of its right-hand operand to its left-hand operand only if the left-hand operand evaluates to `null`. The `??=` operator doesn't evaluate its right-hand operand if the left-hand operand evaluates to non-null.
