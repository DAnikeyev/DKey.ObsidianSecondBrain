 A small native host embedded into the executable, compiled for the target OS and architecture. When you run your self-contained app, that native host starts up first, loads the bundled .NET runtime libraries, and then transfers control to your projectâ€™s managed entry point. Can be created by publishing or building the application with the `--self-contained` option.
