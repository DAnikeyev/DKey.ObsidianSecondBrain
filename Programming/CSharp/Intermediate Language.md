___
Source code for  C# and other .Net languages is compiled into IL. CLR converts IL into native code specific for the platform and enviroment, using [[JIT|Just-In-Time]] compilation. Ahead-of-Time compilation is also available to improve startup time (mostly used for [[iOS]])

 The container for IL code (and some metadata) is the [[Assembly]].
