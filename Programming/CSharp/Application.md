 Here are some common types of .NET applications:

1. **Console Applications**: Simple command-line programs that run in a console window. They are often used for utility programs or for learning purposes.
    
2. **Windows Forms Applications**: Desktop applications with a graphical user interface (GUI) that run on Windows. They use the Windows Forms library for building the UI.
    
3. **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) Applications**: Another type of desktop application for Windows, which provides more advanced graphics and UI capabilities compared to Windows Forms.
    
4. **ASP.NET Applications**: Web applications and services that run on a web server. ASP.NET provides a framework for building dynamic websites, web APIs, and web services.
    
5. **Blazor Applications**: A modern web framework that allows developers to build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor can run client-side in the browser via WebAssembly or server-side.
    
6. **Xamarin Applications**: Mobile applications for iOS and Android, developed using C# and .NET. Xamarin allows for cross-platform mobile app development.
    
7. **MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) Applications**: The evolution of Xamarin, MAUI allows developers to create cross-platform applications for mobile and desktop using a single codebase.
    
8. **Cloud Applications**: Applications designed to run in cloud environments, often leveraging services like Azure Functions or Azure App Services.
    
9. **Microservices**: Small, independently deployable services that together form a larger application. .NET provides tools and libraries to build microservices architectures.
