 - **Traditional Compiler**: `csc.exe` is the command-line executable for the C# compiler that has been part of the .NET Framework for many years. It compiles C# source code into Intermediate Language (IL) code, which can then be executed by the .NET runtime.
- **Part of .NET Framework**: Historically, `csc.exe` was included with the .NET Framework and was used to compile C# code in .NET Framework applications.
- **Command-Line Usage**: Developers can invoke `csc.exe` directly from the command line to compile C# code files into assemblies (DLLs or EXEs).
