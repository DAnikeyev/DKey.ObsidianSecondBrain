 In Windows, the user-mode stack is a crucial component of every thread’s execution context. Unlike the kernel stack that's used when the thread is executing kernel code, the user-mode stack operates entirely within the process’s address space and is used during normal application execution.

## Responsibilities

• Memory for Function Calls and Local Variables:  
The user-mode stack provides storage for the function call frames. Each time a function is called, a new frame is pushed on the stack containing the return address, parameters, and local variables.

• Control Flow Management:  
It helps manage the return addresses and nested function calls. When a function completes, the stack unwinds by popping the top frame to determine where to continue execution.

• Exception Handling Support:  
The stack holds data structures and metadata (like stack frames with linked exception handling records) that are needed when an exception occurs, enabling the system to locate the appropriate handlers.

• Stack Overflow Protection:  
A portion of the reserved stack space is typically marked as a guard region. This helps detect stack overflows by triggering an exception before the corrupting of adjacent memory areas.

• Dynamic Allocation and Deallocation:  
While the size of the stack is set at thread creation, it can grow or shrink within the reserved memory limits based on the depth of the function call chain or the allocation of local variables.
