___
 Individual declarations in a `.proto` file can be annotated with a number of _options_. Options do not change the overall meaning of a declaration, but may affect the way it is handled in a particular context. The complete list of available options is defined in [`/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto)
It is possible to create custom options, but this is rarely necessary.
