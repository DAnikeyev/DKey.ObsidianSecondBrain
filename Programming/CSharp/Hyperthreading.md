 Hyperthreading, also known as Intel Hyper-Threading Technology (HTT), is a technology used in Intel processors to improve parallelization of computations. It allows a single physical processor core to appear as two logical processors to the operating system, enabling it to handle multiple threads simultaneously.

1. **Logical Cores**: With hyperthreading, each physical core is divided into two logical cores. This means that a quad-core processor with hyperthreading will appear to the operating system as having eight cores.
    
2. **Improved Multitasking**: By allowing multiple threads to run on each core, hyperthreading can improve the efficiency of CPU resource usage. This is particularly beneficial for applications that are designed to take advantage of multiple threads, such as video editing software, 3D rendering programs, and some games.
    
3. **Resource Sharing**: The logical cores share the physical core's resources, such as the execution units, cache, and memory bandwidth. Hyperthreading can improve performance by keeping the execution units busier, reducing idle time.
    
4. **Performance Gains**: While hyperthreading can lead to performance improvements, the gains are not always double because the logical cores share the same physical resources. The actual performance increase depends on the workload and how well it can be parallelized.
