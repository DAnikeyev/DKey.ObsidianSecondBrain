___
 This type of thread keeps the application alive as long as it is running. The application will not terminate until all foreground threads have completed their execution. This is useful for tasks that are essential to the application's operation and should not be interrupted or terminated prematurely. You can set property IsBackground to false to make a thread a foreground thread. The default value is false.
