 Produces the set difference of two sequences. The set difference of two sets is defined as the members of the first set that don't appear in the second set.
 If you want to compare sequences of objects of some custom data type, you have to implement [IEquatable T](IEquatable%20T.md) interface or pass [IEqualityComparer](IEqualityComparer.md) as a parameter.
