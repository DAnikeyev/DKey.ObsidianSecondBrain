 Concurrency refers to an applicationâ€™s ability to handle multiple tasks in an interleaved manner (e.g., via context switching or task scheduling), while parallelism involves executing multiple tasks literally at the same time on different CPU cores. In C#, concurrency often uses async/await Task-based programming, whereas parallelism can use constructs like Parallel.For or multiple threads to run code simultaneously.
