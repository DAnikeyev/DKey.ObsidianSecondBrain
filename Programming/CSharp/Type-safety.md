In C# instances of types can interact only through protocols they define, thereby ensuring each typeâ€™s internal consistency. For instance, C# prevents you from interacting with a string type as though it were an integer type.
C# supports static typing, meaning that the language enforces type safety at compile time. This is in addition to type safety being enforced at runtime
