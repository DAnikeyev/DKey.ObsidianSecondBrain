 dotTrace is a performance profiling tool developed by JetBrains for .NET applications. It helps developers identify performance bottlenecks in their applications by providing detailed insights into how the application executes.
## Profiling modes
- **Sampling**: Provides a quick overview of performance with minimal overhead.
- **Tracing**: Offers detailed information about method calls but with more overhead.
- **Line-by-line**: Provides the most detailed information, including line-level performance data, but with the highest overhead.
