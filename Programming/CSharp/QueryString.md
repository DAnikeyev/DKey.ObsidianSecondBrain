 A query string is a part of a [[URL]] that contains data to be passed to web applications as a series of key-value pairs. It appears after the path and is separated from it by a question mark (`?`), with multiple parameters separated by ampersands (`&`). You can use `[From Query]` attribute in [Controller in Asp.Net](Controller%20in%20Asp.Net.md)
