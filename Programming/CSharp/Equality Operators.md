The [= = (equality)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/equality-operators#equality-operator-) and [`!=` (inequality)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/equality-operators#inequality-operator-) operators check if their operands are equal or not. Value types are equal when their contents are equal. Reference types are equal when the two variables refer to the same storage.
