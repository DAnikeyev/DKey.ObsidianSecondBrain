___
an acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol

It is an XML-based protocol consisting of three parts:

- an envelope, which defines the message structure and how to process it
- a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined datatypes
- a convention for representing procedure calls and responses

SOAP has three major characteristics:

1. _extensibility_ (security and [WS-Addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WS-Addressing "WS-Addressing") are among the extensions under development)
2. _neutrality_ (SOAP can operate over any protocol such as [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP "HTTP"), [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP "SMTP"), [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol"), [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP-over-UDP "SOAP-over-UDP"))
3. _independence_ (SOAP allows for any [programming model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_model "Programming model"))
