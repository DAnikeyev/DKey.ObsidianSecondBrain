 Endpoints are the code units—such as methods, controllers, or delegate functions—that handle these [HTTP](HTTP.md) requests. When a request is received, the routing system evaluates the defined routes to find an endpoint that matches the request's [URL](URL.md) and HTTP method. Once a match is found, the associated endpoint is invoked to process the request and return a response.
