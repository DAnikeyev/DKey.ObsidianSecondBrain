 IWebHost and IWebHostBuilder are two important interfaces in ASP.NET Core that play distinct roles in running your web application.

Overview:

â€¢ IWebHost

- Represents the web host which is responsible for managing the lifetime of the app and its infrastructure.
- It encapsulates the server (such as Kestrel), request processing pipeline, and all middleware.
- Once created and started, the host accepts HTTP requests and processes them via the ASP.NET Core pipeline.
