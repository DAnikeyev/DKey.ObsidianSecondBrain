 The thread kernel-mode stack is a dedicated area of memory used exclusively when a thread transitions into kernel mode. Unlike the user-mode stack, it is not directly managed by your application code but is rather controlled by the operating system. Data is copied between the user-mode stack and the kernel-mode stack during system calls, interrupts, and exceptions. The kernel-mode stack is isolated from user-mode memory to ensure the security and stability of the system. It is typically smaller than the user-mode stack and has strict bounds to prevent runaway faults that might affect system stability.

## Responsibilities
• Execution of System Calls:  
When a thread makes a system call (for instance, to access hardware or perform I/O operations), execution switches from user mode to kernel mode. During this transition, the thread switches from its user-mode stack to its kernel-mode stack where the operating system executes critical system code.

• Handling Interrupts and Exceptions:  
The kernel-mode stack is used to process hardware interrupts and exceptions. Since these events must be handled safely and within a controlled environment, the kernel-mode stack provides the necessary isolated space for executing the interrupt service routines (ISRs) and exception handlers.

• Maintaining Kernel Context:  
In kernel mode, the operating system needs to store and manage information specific to the current context, such as processor state, kernel-level data structures, and execution flow. The kernel-mode stack holds this context during transitions (e.g., context switches or handling critical sections of kernel code).

• Security and Stability:  
Isolating the kernel-mode stack from user-mode memory helps prevent a range of security issues. For example, even if a vulnerability exists in user code, the separation protects critical system routines and data from being directly tampered with. The kernel-mode stack is typically smaller and has strict bounds to reduce the risk of runaway faults that might affect system stability.
