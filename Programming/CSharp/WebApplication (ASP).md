 WebApplication  
• Represents the configured web app instance that is ready to configure middleware and endpoints, and then run the application.  
• Obtained by calling builder.Build() on a [WebApplicationBuilder](WebApplicationBuilder.md) instance.  
• Provides a simplified API for setting up request pipelines, routing, and endpoints, eliminating the need for a traditional Startup class.  
• It also handles common hosting patterns like mapping controllers, minimal APIs, and static files, making it easier for developers to quickly set up and run web applications.
