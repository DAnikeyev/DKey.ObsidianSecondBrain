 Use the `static` modifier to declare a static member, which belongs to the type itself rather than to a specific object. The `static` modifier can be used to declare `static` classes. In classes, interfaces, and structs, you may add the `static` modifier to fields, methods, properties, operators, events, and constructors. The `static` modifier can't be used with indexers or finalizers.
